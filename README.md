Working on Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination ([SVOGI](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2011-09_Interactive-Indirect-Illumination/GIVoxels-pg2011-authors.pdf)).

## Build
#### Windows
``` console
> cd src
> build.bat
```
Set the working directory to <code>data</code> folder and run <code>build\win32.exe</code>.


## Why build from scratch?
I simply wanted to understand how games worked under the hood.  
It turned out to be a programmer's deepest rabbit hole.  
Fortunately, being a control freak (I mean, who isn’t?), I was fascinated by the fact that making a game from the lowest level requires a superior skill set.  
If everyone relies solely on Unity and Unreal Engine, there will be no one left to create the next Unity or Unreal.  
No one will be left to build specialized game engines tailored for specific games.  



## Credit
Thanks to some apex programmers, like  
- [Casey Muratori](https://x.com/cmuratori)
- [Jonathan Blow](https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow)
- [Sean Barrett](https://nothings.org/)

who consistently share quality knowledge on the internet, I’ve been able to push through until now.  
For anyone looking to take the first step in building their own game from scratch, I highly recommend Casey Muratori's renowned project, [Handmade Hero](https://guide.handmadehero.org/code/#).
