## Why build from scratch?
I simply wanted to understand how games worked under the hood.  
It turned out to be a programmer's deepest rabbit hole.  
Fortunately, being a control freak (I mean, who isn’t?), I was fascinated by the fact that making a game from the lowest level requires a superior skill set.
