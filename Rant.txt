0. fwrite
    This API is a mistake. No writing location leads to a problem in
    multi-threading. Behind a scene, if you did had a streaming concept, it's
    gonna have to record where the stream has thought to record in. Using with
    seek() won't help.

1. Exceptions
    Casey doesn't know a single good programmer who thinks exception is a good
    idea, especially in, of course, C++.

2. WIN32 API
    What a bullshit cluster-fuck. Is it my skill issue or microsoft devs who 
    made this are actual douches? This sucks fr. Jesus, I'm afraid of the time 
    when Windows 13 comes.
